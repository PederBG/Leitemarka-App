## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
We have used JFoenix for the GUI of the project and to be able to use JFoenix you will need to use Java 8 for as a running environment, as it is not compatible with Java 9.

Furthermore if you want to edit the fxml-files in Scenebuilder you will need to add JFoenix and FontAwesome as a dependency there

### Installation
Clone the project from GitLab and set it up as a maven project (git@gitlab.stud.iie.ntnu.no:tdt4140-2018/75.git).


## Languages 
-Java 

-JavaFX for GUI with JFoenix and FontAwesome as addons

-MySql as database

Also, the tests are run at GitLab everytime a commit is pushed.
